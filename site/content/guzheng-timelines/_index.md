      The Guzheng has changed a great deal over the years. This timeline can
      help you understand how those changes took place. Each time period tries
      to have a representation of the zheng that was common during that time
      period. The instruments shown should not be taken as the only type of
      zheng that was in use during that time. Instruments based on earlier
      designs were likely still in use in different regions, and there may have
      been additional designs not captured here. If you know of any, get in

      So that brings us to the 20th century. A lot has happened and we have
      better records so get ready for the deluge.




      In the 1900s 23 years of sustained war broke out in China. Civil war took
      place in two pieces from 1927-1937 and from 1946-1950. An invasion from
      Japan occurred in the middle alongside Japan’s other actions in World War
      2. One key issue of these conflicts became China's identity. The side in
      power in 1950 decided China's identity had been damaged by the upper
      classes and had to be repaired by the lower classes. Items seen as upper
      class were seized and destroyed. The owners were publicly humiliated,
      exiled to years of hard labor, or worse. The smaller, more popular qin
      zither was one such symbol and was a target. The zheng was seen as a folk
      instrument, or an instrument of the lower classes, and was therefore saved
      from most persecution. (3)




      Once active hostilities wore down music became seen as key tool for
      unifying the country. Zheng-related events moved quickly in part because
      of government initiatives. Here's a breakdown of those events as reported
      by Dr. Han, Dr. Cheng, Gaywood, and Chinese News Analysis:

      Liang Tsai-Ping (Liáng Zài Píng) (梁在平), a guzheng performer, produces
      Zheng Manual (筝谱, Zhēng Pǔ), the first formally published book that
      discussed and described guzheng technique and music. Another leading man
      in the zheng world, Cáo Zhèng  (曹正), produced his instructional book later
      that same year. His is titled Guzheng Manual (古筝谱, Gǔzhēng Pǔ). (4)(5)

      The Pre-Modern timeline is mainly from Cheng 1991 with small additions
      from other sources. The Modern timeline comes from events described in Han
      2013. Cheng has many sources but they are almost exclusively in Chinese,
      limiting my ability to provide context. I've kept all his mentioned
      variants of zhengs in. I have also taken his method of dating events to be
      both indicators of time and of region as dynasties denote both years and
      border changes. To help your mental map I've labeled locations "North" if
      most of their territory sat above modern Hangzhou, approximately north of
      30°31'N, and South if the bulk was below. East/West/Central refer to
      relative location within the borders of modern-day China.

      (3): Chinese history is complex. In depth discussion is, unfortunately,
      far outside the scope of a website about a musical instrument. For those
      interested in learning more, please consider Lazlo Montgomery's [China
      History Podcast](http://teacup.media/the-china-history-podcast/). [The
      civil war is covered in 4 parts in episodes
      119-122](http://teacup.media/?s=civil+war).




      (4): Liang Tsai-Ping previously wrote an earlier work titled "Proposed
      Zheng Manual" (拟筝谱, Nǐ Zhēng Pǔ) in 1938. Depending on definitions that
      could be considered the earliest produced instructional guide, but I am
      under the impression it  did not get a wide release. Also,  Dr. Han lists
      Cao Zheng's work as being "unpublished" but available in the Library of
      the Chinese National Academy of the Arts; Dr. Te-yuan Cheng makes no
      distinction.




      (5): It's important to note that the character "谱" (pǔ) translated here as
      "Manual" also means "guidebook", "reference", or can be shorthand for
      "musical score". Both Liang Tsai-Ping and Cao Zheng's books were all of
      these, from what I understand. I have yet to see a copy myself.




      (6): The Luxun Academy of Arts was founded in 1938 by Chinese leaders in
      Yan'an, Shaanxi province. It was moved in 1940 to Shenyang, Liaoning
      Province. The music department was spun off as Shenyang Conservatory of
      Music in 1958.
