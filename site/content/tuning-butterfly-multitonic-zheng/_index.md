      The Butterfly guzheng is setup with separate sides, 25 on the left and 24
      on the right. The left side has 21 long strings and 4 short, the right
      side has 20 long strings and 4 short strings. We’ll follow the same
      counting convention of 1 is high, 25 is low. Keep in mind this means the
      list shows highest pitch at the top, while the diagram shows lowest at the
      top.




      Tuning is taken from Kwok 1987.
