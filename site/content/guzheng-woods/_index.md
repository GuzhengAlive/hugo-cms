      One of the biggest choices in guzheng manufacture is the woods that are
      used to create the instruments. Thanks to incredible work by Carol Chang
      of ChineseZither.net  we have put together a guide on why words like
      "Sandalwood" and "Wutong" aren't as meaningful as they might seem and a
      list of the woods youâ€™l see advertised as well as their actual genus and
      species.
