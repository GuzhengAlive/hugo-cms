  - text: "Sure the 21-string is popular but what about the older styles with fewer strings and the new styles with more? The normal tuning process is the same but the note range changes.\r\n\n\r\n\nRemember:\r\n\n\r\n\nString 1 is usually closest to the performer, tuned highest, and String 16, 26, etc is farthest, tuned lowest. Older references sometimes count in the other direction.\r\n\n\r\n\nIf one of every 5 strings is colored then the colored string is typically an A.\r\n\n\r\n\nIf two of every 7 strings is colored your instrument is probably intended for the Diatonic scale. The tunings on this page donâ€™t apply.\r\n\n\r\n\nAll of the below are in key of G for ease of writing. See the guide to Key Changes to switch to other keys."
