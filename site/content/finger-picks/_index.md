      Nails are sold by their size (型号, xínghào). Size depends on the length of
      your middle finger’s pad, measured from the tip to your first knuckle.
      Your goal is to have nails that cover most of your pad and extend 3-5mm
      beyond the tip of your finger.  Sizes are recommended for certain ages or
      certain heights. In general:


      **Small  (小号, xiǎo hào):** 


      Who: children below the age of 9 or under 1.3m tall (51 inches, 4’3”) 


      Nail Lengths: Finger:22-23mm Thumb: 24-25mm


      **Medium (中号, zhōng hào):** 


      Who: adolescents between 10-15 or between 1.3 and 1.6m tall (51-63 inches)


      Nail Lengths: 24-26mm Thumb:27-28mm


      **Large (大号, dà hào):**


      Who: people over the age of 16 or taller than 1.6m (63 inches, 5’3”)


      Nail Lengths: 27-29mm Thumb: 30-31mm




      Thumb nails are measured by the furthest two points on the nail. Two nails
      can have the same thumb length but vastly different reach and design.
