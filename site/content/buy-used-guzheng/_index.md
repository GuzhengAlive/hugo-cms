      Used guzheng are an affordable option for new players. But if you are new,
      how do you know if an instrument is worth buying? Read this guide of
      course! I wrote this because I have seen too many damaged instruments
      listed as “like new” and too many modern instrument sold as “antique” (if
      it has 21 strings it isn’t “antique”). Read on to learn about what a
      reasonable price is and what issues make an instrument worth less. If you
      want to buy a new instrument, check out the Buy New guide.




      This guide is intended for instruments that are less than 30 years old.
      Scroll down for pictures of different types of issues.

      Carefully tune and play the guzheng. If it sounds good, was well
      maintained, and has no damage, expect to pay 2/3 of what it would be brand
      new.
  - heading: Pricing Math
    text: >-
      The price of a used instrument should represent the quality of its sound,
      how much performance life the instrument has left, and its appeal as a
      work of art. Modern instruments give us a baseline to compare against.




      The “2/3 of original price” is just a guideline. A more complicated
      recommendation is: At 3 years: 70% of purchase price. At 5 years, 60%. At
      10 years, 50%. Beyond 10 years the main issues become wear, tear, and
      damage. These will push prices below that 50%.




      There are multiple Tiers of guzheng, think “Beginner”, “Professional”,
      etc. Different stores apply different labels to each tier so we’ll go by
      price. 




      **Tier 0**: <$400. **Tier 1**: $400-$600. **Tier 2**: $600-$900. **Tier
      3**: $900-$1500. **Tier 4**: $1,500-$4,000. **Tier 5**: $4,000-$20,000+.




      Tier 0 is for travel-sized and smaller instruments. You give up sound
      quality but they are easier to travel with. Build quality and decoration
      are typically simple and inexpensive. Tier 1 is for new students. They
      sound good but may not emphasize certain ranges. Decorations are on the
      simpler and less expensive side. Tier 2 has improved sound and decoration
      and may use some higher-quality woods. Tier 3 sees further gains in sound
      and decoration as well as better woods. Tier 4 makes substantial gains in
      wood quality, artistic effort, and overall appeal. Tier 5 is everything
      again and then some- woods aged for 50 years, personal projects by master
      craftsmen, precious inlays, factory specials… the range is vast.




      Most used instruments are Tiers 1-3. Tier 0 are less desirable so fewer
      are purchased. Tiers 4 and 5 are rarer and don’t get resold as often. Your
      challenge as you evaluate a guzheng is to figure out what tier it came
      from, how old it is, and then look for issues that would lower the value
      and price.




      We could collectively push for lower prices but we need to find a balance.
      Lowering the prices of used instruments reduces the demand for new
      instruments and thus, how many new instruments stores can sell. It also
      reduces what players can resell their instruments for in the future. We
      want stores in business, we want to be able to resell our instruments, but
      we also want good, affordable, used guzheng so newcomers can enjoy this
      incredible instrument. That said, let’s talk about how we approach
      balanced prices.




      ## Price Reasons


      The price for a used guzheng should be based on its sound quality,
      performance life left, and its appeal as a work of art. The first two
      decrease with age, the third may not.




      First, on sound quality: How does the guzheng sound now? Tune it and play
      it. Are notes clear and distinguishable or do they all blur together? Are
      there any strange metallic sounds, buzzings, or weird secondary noises?
      Does a particular string sound dead or dull? All in all, do you like how
      it sounds? A well-made, high-level instrument will sound terrific. A
      low-grade or damaged instrument may not be pleasing even when tuned. The
      better it sounds now, the more it should cost.




      Second, on performance lifespan: mass-market Tier 1-Tier 3 guzheng change
      their sound over time. The current preference is for the sound of younger
      guzheng. So, age reduces price. Put another way, for how many more years
      will you like its sound? How may years do you have before you would not
      play it for other people? This is less of a concern if you intend to only
      play privately. This is a serious consideration if you are performing
      publicly. The older it is the less performance life it has left, so the
      less it should cost.




      Third: Guzheng are works of art. Many owners enjoy displaying the
      instrument in their home. The better it looks, the higher it should cost.
      This is subjective; I’ve seen Tier 2 guzheng that were more appealing to
      me than Tier 4. If there is visible damage, markings, or cracks, the "art”
      value of the instrument may drop. But then again, you may prefer the
      historic look of an aged, cracked instrument. As I said, it’s subjective.




      Fourth: Prices change over time. Whether it be inflation, exchange rate,
      or demand, guzheng change in price over time. Expect used guzheng to be
      priced as fractions of current prices, not what was paid when it was first
      purchased.




      ## Price Sanity Check 


      A brand new Dunhuang Duo Crane style is currently $600-1000 USD depending
      on the particular model (Feb 2019). Buy a 10-year old instrument from a
      retiring teacher and this price guide says you should pay $300-$500. That
      feels right.




      Put another way: instruments lose $4-$8 of value each month. Again, that
      seems reasonable. So with 3-30, 5-40 and 10-50 as our discounts, let’s
      look at other reasons you should ask for lower prices.
  - heading: Issues
    text: >-
      All of the earlier pricing math assumes the guzheng is in pristine
      condition. Most won’t be. You’ll see Wear, Maintenance Issues, Damage, and
      Build Quality issues that could move the price lower.
