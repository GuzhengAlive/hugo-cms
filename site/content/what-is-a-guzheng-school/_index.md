      Oh boy is this complicated. There are between 2 and 15 schools depending
      on how you count. Usually 5 or 6 schools are named, so how do we get to
      15? Read on to learn more! (Visit the Schools and Styles page to learn
      about the characteristics of each school.) . For now, let’s start at the
      beginning.

      The relevant Mandarin word is liúpài (流派). Liúpài is a concept of
      classification reserved for higher art forms. A “school” as we translate
      to English captures the idea of a style that is passed down from one
      artist to the next, something that goes beyond genre or type. Let’s use
      painting as an example. A painter could create a still life in romantic
      style or in an abstract style. These are very different styles but are of
      the same “genre” of painting - a still life. So too is it with zheng
      music. Two songs can both be focused on telling an important story, but be
      played with different styles. The differences, the nuances, are what were
      taught and passed down within a particular guzheng “school”.




      Guzheng music was not considered high art until the 1950s or 60s so there
      were no nationally recognized liúpài until then. People have had to create
      liúpài very recently- and since guzheng music has exploded in diversity
      and blending in those same 60 or so years, boy has it been hard to agree
      on what constitutes a “school”.




      The most popular naming convention is the geographical region the music
      can be traced back to. The earliest known mention of zheng liúpài came in
      1936 when a musician labeled their record as běipài or northern style
      (北派). (Han 2013) Soon there was a southern style (nánpài 南派). Musicians in
      the north and south offered even more specific names based on things like
      the techniques players used. Schools started to get named after provinces,
      schools, and ethnic groups. 




      When you add all of the names together we get: 


      * 8 major regional schools, 

      * 2 major foreign schools, 

      * 11 almost-synonyms that are roughly equivalent with the first 10
      schools, 

      * 3 true synonyms, 

      * 3 problematic terms,

      * and 5 contentious/defunct schools.


      Here are three diagrams that show how all these relate to each other. The
      first shows the schools that fall roughly in the “North” category. The
      second shows “South” and the third show other names you might encounter as
      you search.
