      Guzheng are tuned in Major Pentatonic Keys. The most common are D and G
      but you will encounter others. You change keys by shifting one bridge in
      each octave to the left or right.




      Itâ€™s also important to know that the notation on sheet music changes with
      each key.  The number "1" on a guzheng score corresponds to the first
      scale degree or tonic note - the same note the key is named after.
