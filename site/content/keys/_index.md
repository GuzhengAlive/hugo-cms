      Guzheng are tuned in Major Pentatonic Keys. The most common are D and G
      but you will encounter others. You change keys by shifting one bridge in
      each octave to the left or right.


      Itâ€™s also important to know that the notation on sheet music changes with
      each key.  The number "1" on a guzheng score corresponds to the first
      scale degree or tonic note - the same note the key is named after.

      their notes, and their notation.")


      For example:


      The Key of D has the notes D,E,F#,A,B. The 1st scale degree or tonic note
      is D. So, sheet music is written as 1,2,3,5,6 where D=1. The Key of G
      shifts each F# bridge slightly to the right to become G. You end up with
      the notes D,E,G,A,B, BUT we change the notation to start counting with G
      =1. So on sheet music, 1,2,3,5,6 means G,A,B,D,E.


      Confusing, right? Well, there's one helpful principle: If your
      instrument's bridges are placed correctly you'll notice alternating sets
      of 3 and 2. The left bridge in the set of 3 is always number 1 on sheet
      music. This holds for all of the following 9 keys.

      There are several keys that can be reached from D by shifting bridges to
      the right.

      Starting with key of D: (D,E,F#,A,B)

      Change to key of G by moving F# bridges to the right until they play G.
